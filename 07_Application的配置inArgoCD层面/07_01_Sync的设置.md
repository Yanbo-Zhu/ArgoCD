https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/

Argo CD has the ability to automatically sync an application when it detects differences between the desired manifests in Git, and the live state in the cluster. A benefit of automatic sync is that CI/CD pipelines no longer need direct access to the Argo CD API server to perform the deployment. Instead, the pipeline makes a commit and push to the Git repository with the changes to the manifests in the tracking Git repo.

To configure automated sync run:

```
argocd app set <APPNAME> --sync-policy automated
```

Alternatively, if creating the application an application manifest, specify a syncPolicy with an `automated` policy.

```
spec:
  syncPolicy:
    automated: {}
```

## 1.1 Automatic Pruning[¶](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/#automatic-pruning "Permanent link")

By default (and as a safety mechanism), automated sync will not delete resources when Argo CD detects the resource is no longer defined in Git. To prune the resources, a manual sync can always be performed (with pruning checked). Pruning can also be enabled to happen automatically as part of the automated sync by running:

```
argocd app set <APPNAME> --auto-prune
```

Or by setting the prune option to true in the automated sync policy:

```
spec:
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
```

## 1.2 Automatic Pruning with Allow-Empty (v1.8)[¶](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/#automatic-pruning-with-allow-empty-v18 "Permanent link")

By default (and as a safety mechanism), automated sync with prune have a protection from any automation/human errors when there are no target resources. It prevents application from having empty resources. To allow applications have empty resources, run:

```
argocd app set <APPNAME> --allow-empty
```

Or by setting the allow empty option to true in the automated sync policy:

```
spec:
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      allowEmpty: true
```

## 1.3 Automatic Self-Healing[¶](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/#automatic-self-healing "Permanent link")

By default, changes that are made to the live cluster will not trigger automated sync. To enable automatic sync when the live cluster's state deviates from the state defined in Git, run:

```
argocd app set <APPNAME> --self-heal
```

Or by setting the self heal option to true in the automated sync policy:

```
spec:
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      selfHeal: true
```

## 1.4 Automated Sync Semantics

- An automated sync will only be performed if the application is OutOfSync. Applications in a Synced or error state will not attempt automated sync.
- Automated sync will only attempt one synchronization per unique combination of commit SHA1 and application parameters. If the most recent successful sync in the history was already performed against the same commit-SHA and parameters, a second sync will not be attempted, unless `selfHeal` flag is set to true.
- If `selfHeal` flag is set to true then sync will be attempted again after self heal timeout (5 seconds by default) which is controlled by `--self-heal-timeout-seconds` flag of `argocd-application-controller` deployment.
- Automatic sync will not reattempt a sync if the previous sync attempt against the same commit-SHA and parameters had failed.
- Rollback cannot be performed against an application with automated sync enabled.
- The automatic sync interval is determined by [the `timeout.reconciliation` value in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/#how-often-does-argo-cd-check-for-changes-to-my-git-or-helm-repository), which defaults to `180s` (3 minutes).




# 2 Sync Options[¶](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-options/#sync-options "Permanent link")

https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-options/

Argo CD allows users to customize some aspects of how it syncs the desired state in the target cluster. Some Sync Options can be defined as annotations in a specific resource. Most of the Sync Options are configured in the Application resource `spec.syncPolicy.syncOptions` attribute. Multiple Sync Options which are configured with the `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options` annotation can be concatenated with a `,` in the annotation value; white spaces will be trimmed.

Below you can find details about each available Sync Option:

# 3 Selective Sync


A _selective sync_ is one where only some resources are sync'd. You can choose which resources from the UI:

![selective sync](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/assets/selective-sync.png)

When doing so, bear in mind:

- Your sync is not recorded in the history, and so rollback is not possible.
- Hooks are not run.

## 3.1 Selective Sync Option

> v1.8

Turning on selective sync option which will sync only out-of-sync resources. See [sync options](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-options/#selective-sync) documentation for more details.




# 4 Sync Phases and Waves¶

https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/


Argo CD executes a sync operation in a number of steps. At a high-level, there are three phases pre-sync, sync and post-sync.

Within each phase you can have one or more waves, that allows you to ensure certain resources are healthy before subsequent resources are synced. 



## 4.1 How Do I Configure Phases?[¶](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/#how-do-i-configure-phases "Permanent link")

Pre-sync and post-sync can only contain hooks. Apply the hook annotation:

```
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync
```

[Read more about hooks](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/resource_hooks/).

## 4.2 How Do I Configure Waves?[¶](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/#how-do-i-configure-waves "Permanent link")

Specify the wave using the following annotation:

```
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "5"
```

Hooks and resources are assigned to wave zero by default. The wave can be negative, so you can create a wave that runs before all other resources.

## 4.3 How Does It Work?[¶](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/#how-does-it-work "Permanent link")

When Argo CD starts a sync, it orders the resources in the following precedence:

- The phase
- The wave they are in (lower values first for creation & updation and higher values first for deletion)
- By kind (e.g. [namespaces first and then other Kubernetes resources, followed by custom resources](https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/blob/bc9ce5764fa306f58cf59199a94f6c968c775a2d/pkg/sync/sync_tasks.go#L27-L66))
- By name

It then determines the number of the next wave to apply. This is the first number where any resource is out-of-sync or unhealthy.

It applies resources in that wave.

It repeats this process until all phases and waves are in-sync and healthy.

Because an application can have resources that are unhealthy in the first wave, it may be that the app can never get to healthy.

During pruning of resources, resources from higher waves are processed first before moving to lower waves. If, for any reason, a resource isn't removed/pruned in a wave, the resources in next waves won't be processed. This is to ensure proper resource cleanup between waves.

Note that there's currently a delay between each sync wave in order give other controllers a chance to react to the spec change that we just applied. This also prevent Argo CD from assessing resource health too quickly (against the stale object), causing hooks to fire prematurely. The current delay between each sync wave is 2 seconds and can be configured via environment variable `ARGOCD_SYNC_WAVE_DELAY`.


# 5 Sync Windows[¶](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync_windows/#sync-windows "Permanent link")

https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync_windows/

Sync windows are configurable windows of time where syncs will either be blocked or allowed. These are defined by a kind, which can be either `allow` or `deny`, a `schedule` in cron format and a duration along with one or more of either `applications`, `namespaces` and `clusters`.


# 6 Sync Applications with Kubectl through operation in spec file 

You can use "kubectl" to ask Argo CD to synchronize applications the same way you can use the CLI or UI. Many configurations like "force", "prune", "apply" and even synchronize a specific list of resources are equally supported. This is done by applying or patching the Argo CD application with a document that defines an "operation".

==This "operation" defines how a synchronization should be done and for what resources these synchronization is to be done.==

There are many configuration options that can be added to the "operation". Next, a few of them are explained. For more details, you can have a look at the CRD [applications.argoproj.io](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/crds/application-crd.yaml). Some of them are required, whereas others are optional.

To ask Argo CD to synchronize all resources of a given application, we can do:

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: <app-name>
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  ...
operation:
  initiatedBy:
    username: <username>
  sync:
    syncStrategy:
      hook: {}
```

```
$ kubectl apply -f <apply-file>
```

The most important part is the "sync" definition in the "operation" field. You can pass optional information like "info" or "initiatedBy". "info" allows you to add information about the operation in the form of a list. "initiatedBy" contains information about who initiated the operation request.

Or if you prefer, you also can patch:

```
operation:
  initiatedBy:
    username: <username>
  sync:
    syncStrategy:
    hook: {}
```

```
$ kubectl patch -n <namespace> app <app-name> --patch-file <patch-file> --type merge
```

Be aware that patches, specially with merge strategies, may not work the way you expect especially if you change sync strategies or options. In these cases, "kubectl apply" gives better results.

Either with a "kubectl patch" or "kubectl apply", the state of the synchronization is reported in the "operationState" field in the application object.

```
$ kubectl get -n <namespace> get app <app-name> -o yaml
...
status:
  operationState:
    finishedAt: "2023-08-03T11:16:17Z"
    message: successfully synced (all tasks run)
    phase: Succeeded
```

## 6.1 Apply and Hook synchronization strategies


There are two types of synchronization strategies: "hook", which is the default value, and "apply".

An "apply" sync strategy tells Argo CD to "kubectl apply", whereas a "hook" sync strategy informs Argo CD to submit any resource that's referenced in the operation. This way the synchronization of these resources will take into consideration any hook the resource has been annotated with.

```
operation:
  sync:
    syncStrategy:
      apply: {}
```

```
operation:
  sync:
    syncStrategy:
      hook: {}
```

Both strategies support "force". However, you need to be aware that a force operation deletes the resource when patch encounters a conflict after having retried 5 times.

```
operation:
  sync:
    syncStrategy:
      apply:
        force: true
```

```
operation:
  sync:
    syncStrategy:
      hook:
        force: true
```

## 6.2 Prune

If you want to prune your resources before applying, you can instruct Argo CD to do so:

```
operation:
  sync:
    prune: true
```

## 6.3 List of resources

There's always the possibility to pass a list of resources. This list can be all resources the application manages or only a subset, for example resources that remained out of sync for some reason.

Only "kind" and "name" are required fields when referencing resources, but the fields "groups" and "namespace" can also be defined:

```
operation:
  sync:
    resources:
      - kind: Namespace
        name: namespace-name
      - kind: ServiceAccount
        name: service-account-name
        namespace: namespace-name
      - group: networking.k8s.io
        kind: NetworkPolicy
        name: network-policy-name
        namespace: namespace-name
```

## 6.4 Sync Options

In an operation, you can also pass sync-options. Each of these options is passed as "name=value" pairs. For example:

```
operations:
  sync:
    syncOptions:
      - Validate=false
      - Prune=false
```
